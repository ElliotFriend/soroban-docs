- Do we need:
  - classic asset info?
    - Yes, for import/export
  - dedicated network fees query? or is preflight enough?
  - Client authentication options, i.e. OAuth, Basic, something to protect the service from anonymous abuse.
- Should we also include a strval-style json-ified version of the xdr?
  - in returns? in params? both?
  - It's easier for humans to read/understand, which helps with client-debugging.
  - Conversion to/from xdr.ScVal is lossy.
  - Seems unnecessary. Clients will already have the xdr lib, so can convert it themselves if needed.
