:::danger warning

:::

For reading the current value of contract data ledger entries directly. Allows you to directly inspect the current state of a contract. This is a backup way to access your contract data which may not be available via events or simulateTransaction.

## Parameters

- `contractId`: `<hash>` - (in standard hex string format)
- `key`: `<xdr.ScVal>` - The key of the contract data ledger entry you wish to retrieve (serialized in a base64 string)

## Return

- `<object>`
  - `xdr`: `<xdr.ScVal>` - The current value of the given contract data ledger entry  (serialized in a base64 string)
  - `lastModifiedLedgerSeq`: `<number>` - The ledger number of the last time this entry was updated (optional)
  - `latestLedger`: `<number>` - The current latest ledger observed by the node when this response was generated.
