Clients can request a filtered list of events emitted by a given ledger range. Soroban-RPC will support querying within a maximum X of recent ledgers.

Note, this could be used by the client to only prompt a refresh when there is a new ledger with relevant events. It should also be used by backend Dapp components to "ingest" events into their own database for querying and serving.

If making multiple requests, clients should deduplicate any events received, based on the event's unique id field. This prevents double-processing in the case of duplicate events being received.

By default soroban-rpc retains the most recent 24 hours of events.

## Parameters

- `startLedger`: `<string>` - Stringified ledger sequence number to fetch events after (inclusive).
- `endLedger`: `<string>` - Stringified ledger sequence number to fetch events before (inclusive). endLedger must be less than or equal to startLedger + 4320 (about 6 hours of ledgers).
- `filters`: `<object[]>` - List of filters for the returned events. Events matching any of the filters are included. To match a filter, an event must match both a contractId and a topic. Maximum 5 filters are allowed per request.
  - `type`: `<"system"|"contract">` - (optional) Filter to only system or only contract type events. If omitted, return all.
  - `contractIds`: `<string[]>` - (optional) List of contract ids to query for events. If omitted, return events for all contracts. Maximum 5 contract IDs are allowed per request.
  - `topics`: `<TopicFilter[]>` - (optional) List of topic filters. If omitted, query for all events. If multiple filters are specified, events will be included if they match any of the filters. Maximum 5 filters are allowed per request.
    - A `TopicFilter` is `SegmentMatcher[]`
      - The list can be 1-4 `SegmentMatcher`s long.
    - A `SegmentMatcher` is one of the following:
      - For an exact segment match, a string containing base64-encoded ScVal
      - For a wildcard single-segment match, the string "*", matches exactly one segment.
    - Examples of matching token transfer events. Events are emitted here: [rs-soroban-env/event.rs at 924d86cacd58b8a162344bfe0ab37d9668f5d629]. I've decoded the base64-encoded ScVals for easier reading (both the symbols and addresses). In real usage, the `ScSymbol("transfer").toXdr().toString("base64")`, and `ScBinary(pubkeyBytes).toXdr().toString("base64")`, would be base64 encoded strings for exact matches. For example:
      - `[ScSymbol("transfer"), "*", "*"]`
        - Matches any token transfer events
      - `[ScSymbol("transfer"), "*", "GABC...123"]`
        - Matches any token transfer events to recipient: GABC...123
      - `[ScSymbol("transfer"), "GDEF...456", "GABC...123"]`
        - Matches only token transfers from GDEF...456 to GABC...123.
- pagination: `<PaginationOptions>` - See "[Pagination](../index#pagination)"

## Returns

- `<object>`
  - `events`: `<object[]>`
    - `ledger`: `<string>` - String-ified sequence number of the ledger.
    - `ledgerClosedAt`: `<string>` - ISO8601 timestamp of the ledger closing time.
    - `contractId`: `<string>` - ID of the emitting contract.
    - `id`: `<string>` - Unique identifier for this event.
      - The event's unique id field is based on a [`toid` from Horizon] as used in Horizon's /effects endpoint.
      - https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/internal/db2/history/effect.go#L58
      - Specifically, it is a string containing:
      - bigint(32 bit ledger sequence + 20 bit txn number + 12 bit operation) + `<hyphen>` + number for the event within the operation.
      - For example:
        - 1234-1
    - `pagingToken`: `<string>` - Duplicate of `id` field, but in the standard place for pagination tokens.
    - `topic`: `<xdr.ScVal[]>` - List containing the topic this event was emitted with.
    - `value`: `<object>` - List containing the topic this event was emitted with.
      - `xdr`: `<xdr.ScVal>` - The emitted body value of the event (serialized in a base64 string).
