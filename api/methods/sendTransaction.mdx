Submit a real transaction to the Stellar network. This is the only way to make changes "on-chain".

Unlike Horizon, this does not wait for transaction completion. It simply validates and enqueues the transaction. Clients should call getTransactionStatus to learn about transaction success/failure.

This supports all transactions, not only smart contract-related transactions.

- TODO: Decide on submit-vs-send for naming
- TODO: Add a return value that would represent the minimal amount of time the client would need to wait before calling getTransactionStatus

## Parameters

- `<xdr.TransactionEnvelope>` - The signed transaction to broadcast (serialized in base64)

## Returns

- `<object>`
  - `id`: `<hash>` The transaction hash (in an hex-encoded string), and the initial transaction status, ("pending" or something), unless we can reject it immediately.
  - `status`: `<status>` - the current status of the transaction by hash, one of:
    - `pending`
    - `success`
    - `error`
  - `error`: `<object>` -  (optional) If the transaction was rejected immediately, this will be an error object. See [`getTransactionStatus`](getTransactionStatus) for format.

## Possible Errors

- TODO: Fewer than existing txsub as not waiting for completion

## Examples
