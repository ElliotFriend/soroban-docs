Fetch a minimal set of current info about a Stellar account.

Needed to get the current sequence number, and balance for the account so you can build a successful transaction.

## Parameters

- `<address>` - Address of the account to lookup

## Returns

- `<object>`
  - `id`: `<address>`
  - `sequence`: `<string>` - Current sequence number of the account
  - `balances`: `<object[]>` - Balances for the account (same format as in horizon).
    - Do we need all classic asset balances? or just lumens, maybe? How does this work with new "smart" assets?
      - Yes. We need classic asset balances, for planning import/export-using contracts.
      - We need classic lumen balances for planning/paying fees.
      - But, these could be found by querying the soroban token wrapper, so maybe this doesn't need to be broken out as a separate thing.
  - TODO: Do we need signers/flags/thresholds/etc?
