For reading the current value of ledger entries directly. Allows you to directly inspect the _current state_ of a contract, a contract's code, or any other ledger entry. This is a backup way to access your contract data which may not be available via events or `simulateTransaction`.

To fetch contract wasm byte-code, use the ContractCode ledger entry key.

## Parameters

- `key`: `<xdr.LedgerKey>` - The key of the ledger entry you wish to retrieve (serialized in a base64 string)

## Return

- `<object>`
  - `xdr`: `<xdr.LedgerEntryData>` - The current value of the given ledger entry  (serialized in a base64 string)
  - `lastModifiedLedgerSeq`: `<number>` - The ledger number of the last time this entry was updated (optional)
  - `latestLedger`: `<number>` - The current latest ledger observed by the node when this response was generated.
